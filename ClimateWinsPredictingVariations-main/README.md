# ClimateWins: Predicting Weather Variations
Predicting Weather Variations for ClimateWins
## Overview

A machine learning project focused on predicting weather variations and assessing the consequences of climate change across Europe. The project leverages various datasets, machine learning models, and data analysis techniques to identify patterns and make climate-related predictions.

## Objectives

- Identify weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.
- Determine if unusual weather patterns are increasing.
- Generate possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based on current trends.
- Determine the safest places for people to live in Europe over the next 25 to 50 years.


## Data Sources

The datasets used in this project include:

- European Climate Assessment & Dataset Project: Historical weather observations from 18 weather stations across Europe, covering variables such as temperature, wind speed, and snow levels.

- NOAA and JMA: Additional hurricane and typhoon data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Japan Meteorological Agency.

## Models and Algorithms

The following machine learning models were implemented and optimized during this project:

1. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

2. Decision Tree

3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

4. Random Forest

## Model Optimization

The project involved optimizing hyperparameters for various models using:

- Grid Search and Random Search for Random Forest models.

- Bayesian Optimization for Keras-based deep learning models.

- Adjusting parameters such as epochs, batch size, learning rates, and number of hidden units.

## Ethical Considerations

Ethical issues related to machine learning in climate predictions include:

- Bias: Potential influence of political agendas on data collection.

- Privacy: Risks associated with monitoring private property and activities.

- This project mitigates these risks by focusing on public weather data.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras.

- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
