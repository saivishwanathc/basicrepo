# Netflix-User-Base-Analysis

## Project Summary
This repository contains an initial data and exploratory analysis of Netflix's revenue data, focusing on understanding how different subscription types, user behaviors, and account preferences impact revenue generation. As an analyst for Netflix, the objective is to derive insights that will inform strategies to enhance user engagement and optimize revenue streams. The analysis explores various factors that drive revenue growth and user retention, aiming to identify key trends and patterns. These insights will help Netflix develop more targeted offerings and improve its pricing strategies, ultimately maximizing revenue while enhancing the user experience.

## Key Questions
