# ClimateWins
CimateWins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world. Their primary concern lies in the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events observed over the past two decades.

## Objective
ClimateWins aims to harness machine learning tools to develop a model capable of predicting weather patterns, including extreme events, across mainland Europe. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, this model has the potential to provide accurate weather forecasts globally, helping communities prepare for and mitigate the impact of severe weather conditions.

## Machine Learning Models explored:

• K-Nearest Neighbour Model

• Decision Tree Model

• Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Hypotheses
• Can machine learning predict a significant increase in average daily temperatures in Europe in the next years?

• Can machine learning effectively predict extreme weather conditions?

• Can machine learning identify a correlation or pattern between extreme weather conditions with other variables, such as heatwave?

## Data & Tools
Dataset based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe.

Contains data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022.

Recordings exist for almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation etc.

This data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project
